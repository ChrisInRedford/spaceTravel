# spaceTravel
spaceTravel, a .NET Web Application created with Visual Studio

The "Published" files can be added directly to IIS and used as a .NET Web Application. 
The only change that needs to be made is to the database. Create a new SQL database and put your own credentials into Web.config.

The "Web" files are the files to import into Visual Studio.
